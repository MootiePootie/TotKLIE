### A live inventory editor for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom version 1.1.2 using sys-botbase

## Usage
After connecting to and loading a page of items from your inventory, clicking on an item will bring it up in the editor on the left, after making any changes to the item you like click the "Update" button and that will update the items data on the grid to the right, then click the "Write Data" button and then the 
data will be written to the games memory. Make sure the item you are editing isnt equipped or else it may not actually update in game. If you are currently looking at the page of items you are editing in game then you will need to refresh that page for the items to visually update.

## To-Do
- Add support for Key Items
- Add support for reading and writing Weapon/Shield Fusions
- Add support for adding/removing items
- Optimize Code (dont look at it, its really bad)

## Requirements
- The latest [sys-botbase](https://github.com/olliz0r/sys-botbase)
- A switch running [atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/releases)

## Additional Notes
This program is currently very experimental so use it at your own risk. I havent personally had any issues with it yet however there is always the risk of one little part that I happened to miss that causes major issues. If you happen to encounter a bug with this program please report it either to this github or contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MootiePootieTW)

Item icons as well as lists for Item names, Modifier Names, and in game Item/Modifier values were taken from [MarcoBledo's TotK save file editor](https://www.marcrobledo.com/savegame-editors/zelda-totk/) I recommend you check it out if you want to directly edit your save file. Right now it has support for a lot more things than this program.
